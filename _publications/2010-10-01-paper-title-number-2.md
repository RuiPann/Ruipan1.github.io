title: "Carbon Tax vs. Emission Trading in a Monopolistically Competitive Market with Heterogeneous Firms"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'We establish a general-equilibrium model to compare the efficiency of two emission 
regulation policies used worldwide: the carbon tax (CT) and the emission trading 
scheme (ETS). Assuming monopolistic competition and heterogeneous firms, we 
show that the ETS is better in an economy with a high degree of heterogeneity, and 
the CT is better otherwise. We also explore how the market distortions under these 
two regulation policies are different. Moreover, we find that the excessive input of an 
immobile resource in manufacturing production may result in market inefficiency.'
